## Why Join WhiteHats?
I want to join WhiteHats to deepen my cybersecurity skills, contribute to ethical hacking projects, and collaborate with experts on real-world threats while advancing my career in server security and penetration testing.


## Cybersecurity Incident:
**Equifax Breach (2017):** Hackers stole 147M people's personal data because they didn't patch Apache Struts.

Hackers exploited an unpatched Apache Struts vulnerability in Equifax's web app, stealing SSNs, birth dates, and addresses of many people. Equifax ignored the March 2017 patch which costed them 1.4 billion dollars  

Lesson: Patch management failures causes massive security risks.
