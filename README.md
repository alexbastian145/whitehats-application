**Equifax Breach (2017):** Hackers stole 147M people's personal data because they didn't patch Apache Struts.

Hackers exploited an unpatched Apache Struts vulnerability (CVE-2017-5638) in Equifax's web app, stealing SSNs, birth dates, and addresses of 147M people over 76 days. Equifax ignored the March 2017 patch which costed them 1.4 billion dollars  

Lesson: Patch management failures causes massive security risks.
